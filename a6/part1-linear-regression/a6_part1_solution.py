# Create the model

# Find the coefficient, bias, and r squared values. 
# Each should be a float and rounded to two decimal places. 


# Print out the linear equation and r squared value

# Predict the the blood pressure of someone who is 42 years old.
# Print out the prediction

# Create the model in matplotlib and include the line of best fit
