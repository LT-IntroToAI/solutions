# Assignment 6 Part 1 - Linear Regression

Go through the class examples before completing `a6_part1.py`.  After completing, make sure to anwer the questions in `part1_writeup.md`.

## Blood Pressure Assignment

**Create the Linear Regression Model**
Write a program that models the relationship between age and systolic blood pressure.

You will need to complete the following steps:

1. Use reshape to turn the x values into a 2D array
2. Determine the coefficient, bias, and R2 values.
3. Print the model’s linear equation and R2 value.
4. Predict the blood pressure of someone who is 48 years old, and print out the value.
Note: You do not need to create a graph to visualize the results.

**Analyze the Data**
Once you have created your model, analyze the data by considering the following questions. You will answer them in the next activity.

1. What is the r squared value? What does this say about this linear regression model?
2. According do your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 43 years old?
3. How accurate do you think this model’s predictions are? Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone’s blood pressure based on their age? Why or why not?
