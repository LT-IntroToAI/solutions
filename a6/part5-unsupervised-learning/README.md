# Unsupervised Learning - part 5

Complete example 1 and example 2 before attempting this problem on customer segmentation.  Make sure to answer the writeups once complete.

## Customer Segmentation

<b>Context:</b> You have been hired by a department store to help them analyze their customer data. They provided you with a dataset that includes each customer’s income and spending habits. Note: This is a toy dataset.

This is the perfect opportunity to put your unsupervised machine learning knowledge to use! You decide to use the k-means algorithm to structure the data so that the marketing team can develop a plan by customer group.

<b>Directions:</b> Follow the steps in the starter code and use the k-means algorithm to analyze the dataset. The number of clusters has been determined for you.

When you run your program, the output should be a scatterplot with five clusters of different colors and five centroids marked with a red “X”.

<b>Analyze</b> When you have successfully developed an unsupervised learning model, use the scatterplot to answer the following questions:

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
